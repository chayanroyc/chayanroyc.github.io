  abstract = {Tropical cyclones (TC) are one of the deadliest natural meteorological hazards with destructive winds and heavy rains, resulting losses often reach billions of dollars, imposing a substantial and long-lasting burden on both local and national economies. The El-Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a tropical ocean{\textendash}atmosphere interaction, is known to significantly impact cyclonic systems over global ocean basins. This study investigates the variability of TC activity in the presence of ENSO over the North Indian Ocean (NIO), comprising the Arabian Sea (ARB) and the Bay of Bengal (BOB) basins during the pre- and post-monsoon season, using accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) over the last 29 years. Our analysis reveals a significant rise in tropical cyclone energy intensity over the past two decades, with eight of the ten most active years occurring since the 2000s. Total ACE over the NIO is found to be higher in La-Ni{\~n}a. Higher ACE observed over ARB is strongly associated with a combination of elevated sea surface height (SSH) anomaly and low vertical wind shear during the El-Ni{\~n}o episodes, with higher sea surface temperatures (SST) during the post-monsoon season. Whereas in the BOB, El Ni{\~n}o not only reduces ACE, but also decreases basin-wide variability, and more pronounced effects during the post-monsoon season, coinciding with warmer SST and higher SSH along the coast during La-Ni{\~n}a.},

  abstract = {While meteorology and aerosols are identified as key drivers of snow cover (SC) variability in High Mountain Asia, complex non-linear interactions between them are not adequately quantified. Here, we attempt to unravel these interactions through a simple relative importance (RI) analysis of meteorological and aerosol variables from ERA5/CAMS-EAC4 reanalysis against satellite-derived SC from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer across 2003{\textendash}2018. Our results show a statistically significant 7\% rise in the RI of aerosol-meteorology interactions (AMI) in modulating SC during late snowmelt season (June and July), notably over low snow-covered (LSC) regions. Sensitivity tests further reveal that the importance of meteorological interactions with individual aerosol species are more prominent than total aerosols over LSC regions. We find that the RI of AMI for LSC regions is clearly dominated by carbonaceous aerosols, on top of the expected importance of dynamic meteorology. These findings clearly highlight the need to consider AMI in hydrometeorological monitoring, modeling, and reanalyses.},
