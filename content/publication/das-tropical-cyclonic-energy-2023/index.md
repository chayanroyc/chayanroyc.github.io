abstract: Tropical cyclones (TC) are one of the deadliest natural meteorological hazards
  with destructive winds and heavy rains, resulting losses often reach billions of
  dollars, imposing a substantial and long-lasting burden on both local and national
  economies. The El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a tropical ocean–atmosphere
  interaction, is known to significantly impact cyclonic systems over global ocean
  basins. This study investigates the variability of TC activity in the presence of
  ENSO over the North Indian Ocean (NIO), comprising the Arabian Sea (ARB) and the
  Bay of Bengal (BOB) basins during the pre- and post-monsoon season, using accumulated
  cyclone energy (ACE) over the last 29 years. Our analysis reveals a significant
  rise in tropical cyclone energy intensity over the past two decades, with eight
  of the ten most active years occurring since the 2000s. Total ACE over the NIO is
  found to be higher in La-Niña. Higher ACE observed over ARB is strongly associated
  with a combination of elevated sea surface height (SSH) anomaly and low vertical
  wind shear during the El-Niño episodes, with higher sea surface temperatures (SST)
  during the post-monsoon season. Whereas in the BOB, El Niño not only reduces ACE,
  but also decreases basin-wide variability, and more pronounced effects during the
  post-monsoon season, coinciding with warmer SST and higher SSH along the coast during
  La-Niña.
