abstract: While meteorology and aerosols are identified as key drivers of snow cover
  (SC) variability in High Mountain Asia, complex non-linear interactions between
  them are not adequately quantified. Here, we attempt to unravel these interactions
  through a simple relative importance (RI) analysis of meteorological and aerosol
  variables from ERA5/CAMS-EAC4 reanalysis against satellite-derived SC from Moderate
  Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer across 2003â€“2018. Our results show a statistically
  significant 7% rise in the RI of aerosol-meteorology interactions (AMI) in modulating
  SC during late snowmelt season (June and July), notably over low snow-covered (LSC)
  regions. Sensitivity tests further reveal that the importance of meteorological
  interactions with individual aerosol species are more prominent than total aerosols
  over LSC regions. We find that the RI of AMI for LSC regions is clearly dominated
  by carbonaceous aerosols, on top of the expected importance of dynamic meteorology.
  These findings clearly highlight the need to consider AMI in hydrometeorological
  monitoring, modeling, and reanalyses.
