Chayanâ€™s present research revolves around understanding the role of light-absorbing aerosols (LAPs : black carbon, dust, brown carbon) on the regional climatic changes in High Mountain Asia (HMA) in recent decades. He is using WRF-Chem and satellite retrievals of AOD from MODIS to identify the relative importance of different sources affecting HMA, and assess the impact of LAPs deposition on snowmelt, runoff characteristics, and water resources in downstream Asian regions.
